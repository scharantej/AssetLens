**HTML Files**

- **templates/index.html**: This will serve as the main page of our web application. It will provide users with an interface to view and analyze the historical values of different assets.

- **templates/insights.html**: This HTML file will display insights and analysis of the asset values. It will provide users with information about the factors that influence the changes and guide them in making informed decisions.

**Routes**

- **/api/asset_data**: This route will serve as an API endpoint to retrieve the historical values of the assets. It will query the database to fetch the data and return it in a suitable JSON format. Here, the client can specify the specific asset, time range, or any other relevant parameters to retrieve targeted data.

- **/api/insights**: This route will generate insights based on the asset values. It may use statistical analysis or predictive models to identify potential trends and correlations, presenting the results through visualizations or textual explanations in a user-friendly manner.

- **/**: This is the root route of our web application. It will render the main **index.html** page where users can interact with the application.

- **app.run(debug=True)**: This line runs the Flask web application in debug mode. It enables automatic reload of the application when changes are made to the code, making it convenient during development.
